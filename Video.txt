Here is a link to a video for the project demo: https://youtu.be/Og2pRQwQzpQ

Some minor notes about the video:
  1. Transitions between some screens may seem a bit slow. This is due to the emulator not being as fast as an actual android phone.
  2. The location is always set at the googleplex in California. This is standaradized when using the emulator.
